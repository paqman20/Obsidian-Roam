* Obsidian-Roam
The overall goal of the project is to have a Obsidian like approach to note taking. I really enjoyed using the Obsidian software. I want a similar expreince inside emacs. Emacs is awesome free software and integrates super tightly with a massive expanse of packages and extensions. The goal is provide as much of a out of the box expreince for emacs as possible that resembles Obsidian. The project is in beta currently
